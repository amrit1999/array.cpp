problem statement:find the largest subarray such that gcd of that subarray is equall to 1.
subarray of gcd means largest factor which is common to all elements of the subarray.



input format:
n:first line contains an integer which denotes the length of a given array, and next n line contains elements of given array.
a[i] is  element in array at index i.

output:
print length of largest subarray such that gcd of subarray is equall to 1.

constarint:

2<=n<=1000000
0<=a[i]<1=0^9


solution:
