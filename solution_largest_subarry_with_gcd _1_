//Explanation:
gcd defination:
largest factor which divides all elements of subarray. so if there exist at least two elements of that subarray such that 
largest common factor of those two elements is 1 then then we can conclude that largest common_factoe for subarray is also 1.
and  maximum length of subarray is equall to length of array. if there is not exist any two elements such that largest common_factor
is equall to 1 then gcd of that subarray never equall to 1.


//mathematically.

let's take array elemnets are a,b,c;
where a<b<c

if b=x*a. ...............1)    //where x is integer

if c=y*b . ...............2)   // where y is integer.
put value of b in eqn 2.
so, c=y*(x*a)
 or c=z*a ---------------------3) /where z=x*y which is integer.
 
from equation 3 we can conclude  if there is no two element exist in subarry such that largest  common_factor is 1 
then gcd of that subarry will never be one.
